# github_utils

## install
* perl Makefile.PL
* make
* make test
* make install

## prerequisites
There are several prereqs for this, but you probably only need to
get at most, two: JSON::XS and WWW::Mechanize.  You can install these
from the CPAN, or you can try installing them with your package manager:
* libjson-xs-perl
* libwww-mechanize-perl
